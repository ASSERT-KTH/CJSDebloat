          ✓ emits an error event
          ✓ unwinds the middleware stack (calling all done functions)
      #register
        ✓ adds to the list of middleware
        ✓ validates the arity of middleware
    Public Middleware APIs
      listener middleware context
        listener
          ✓ is the listener object that matched
          ✓ has options.id (metadata)
        response
          ✓ is a Response that wraps the message
      receive middleware context
        response
          ✓ is a match-less Response object
      next
        ✓ is a function with arity one
      done
        ✓ is a function with arity zero

  Robot
    Unit Tests
      #http
        ✓ creates a new ScopedHttpClient
        ✓ passes options through to the ScopedHttpClient
        ✓ sets a sane user agent
        ✓ merges in any global http options
        ✓ local options override global http options
      #respondPattern
        ✓ matches messages starting with robot's name
        ✓ matches messages starting with robot's alias
        ✓ does not match unaddressed messages
        ✓ matches properly when name is substring of alias
        ✓ matches properly when alias is substring of name
      #listen
        ✓ registers a new listener directly
      #hear
        ✓ registers a new listener directly
      #respond
        ✓ registers a new listener using hear
      #enter
        ✓ registers a new listener using listen
      #leave
        ✓ registers a new listener using listen
      #topic
        ✓ registers a new listener using listen
      #catchAll
        ✓ registers a new listener using listen
      #receive
        ✓ calls all registered listeners
        ✓ sends a CatchAllMessage if no listener matches
        ✓ does not trigger a CatchAllMessage if a listener matches
        ✓ stops processing if a listener marks the message as done
        ✓ gracefully handles listener uncaughtExceptions (move on to next listener)
        ✓ executes the callback after the function returns when there are no listeners
      #loadFile
        ✓ should require the specified file
        proper script
          ✓ should call the script with the Robot
          ✓ should parse the script documentation
        non-Function script
          ✓ logs a warning
        unsupported file extension
          ✓ should not be loaded by the Robot
      #send
        ✓ delegates to adapter "send" with proper context
      #reply
        ✓ delegates to adapter "reply" with proper context
      #messageRoom
        ✓ delegates to adapter "send" with proper context
      #on
        ✓ delegates to events "on" with proper context
      #emit
        ✓ delegates to events "emit" with proper context
    Listener Registration
      #listen
        ✓ forwards the matcher, options, and callback to Listener
      #hear
        ✓ matches TextMessages
        ✓ does not match EnterMessages
      #respond
        ✓ matches TextMessages addressed to the robot
        ✓ does not match EnterMessages
      #enter
        ✓ matches EnterMessages
        ✓ does not match TextMessages
      #leave
        ✓ matches LeaveMessages
        ✓ does not match TextMessages
      #topic
        ✓ matches TopicMessages
        ✓ does not match TextMessages
      #catchAll
        ✓ matches CatchAllMessages
        ✓ does not match TextMessages
    Message Processing
      ✓ calls a matching listener
      ✓ calls multiple matching listeners
      ✓ calls the catch-all listener if no listeners match
      ✓ does not call the catch-all listener if any listener matched
      ✓ stops processing if message.finish() is called synchronously
      ✓ calls non-TextListener objects
      ✓ gracefully handles listener uncaughtExceptions (move on to next listener)
      Listener Middleware
        ✓ allows listener callback execution
        ✓ can block listener callback execution
        ✓ receives the correct arguments
        ✓ executes middleware in order of definition
      Receive Middleware
        ✓ fires for all messages, including non-matching ones
        ✓ can block listener execution
        ✓ receives the correct arguments
        ✓ executes receive middleware in order of definition
        ✓ allows editing the message portion of the given response
      Response Middleware
        ✓ executes response middleware in order
        ✓ allows replacing outgoing strings
        ✓ marks plaintext as plaintext
        ✓ does not send trailing functions to middleware

  User
    new
      ✓ uses id as the default name
      ✓ sets attributes passed in
      ✓ uses name attribute when passed in, not id
