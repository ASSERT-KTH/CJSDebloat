Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding

Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 8.41.0

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "eslint-plugin-ember".

(The package "eslint-plugin-ember" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/data/js-variants/multee/TestCollection/ember-layout-components".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install eslint-plugin-ember@latest --save-dev

The plugin "eslint-plugin-ember" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc.js".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.

npm WARN deprecated ember-cli-htmlbars-inline-precompile@3.0.1: Use ember-cli-htmlbars instead.
npm WARN deprecated uuid@3.3.3: Please upgrade  to version 7 or higher.  Older versions may use Math.random() in certain circumstances, which is known to be problematic.  See https://v8.dev/blog/math-random for details.
npm WARN deprecated source-map-resolve@0.5.2: See https://github.com/lydell/source-map-resolve#deprecated
npm WARN deprecated mkdirp@0.5.1: Legacy versions of mkdirp are no longer supported. Please update to mkdirp 1.x. (Note that the API surface has changed to use Promises in 1.x.)
npm WARN deprecated @babel/polyfill@7.8.7: 🚨 This package has been deprecated in favor of separate inclusion of a polyfill and regenerator-runtime (when needed). See the @babel/polyfill docs (https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-polyfill) for more information.
npm WARN deprecated eslint-plugin-ember-best-practices@1.1.2: This package has been deprecated. Please use eslint-plugin-ember.
npm WARN deprecated core-js@2.6.9: core-js@<3.23.3 is no longer maintained and not recommended for usage due to the number of issues. Because of the V8 engine whims, feature detection in old core-js versions could cause a slowdown up to 100x even if nothing is polyfilled. Some versions have web compatibility issues. Please, upgrade your dependencies to the actual version of core-js.
