Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 7.5.0

ESLint couldn't find the plugin "eslint-plugin-vue".

(The package "eslint-plugin-vue" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "/data/js-variants/multee/TestCollection/nuxt-icon-font".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install eslint-plugin-vue@latest --save-dev

The plugin "eslint-plugin-vue" was referenced from the config file in ".eslintrc.js » @nuxtjs/eslint-config".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat to chat with the team.
