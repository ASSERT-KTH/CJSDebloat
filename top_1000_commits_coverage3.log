  inject.js
    ensureDoctype()
      ✔ should prepend a doctype if not included in the html
      ✔ should not modify an existing doctype
    injectScript()
      ✔ should append scripts when there is no body tag
      ✔ should place scripts right before the closing body tag

  EventBuffer test
    ✔ passes events through the buffer event emitter
    ✔ Is buffering by default and flushes events to the original emitter
    ✔ After flushing, all events get passed and can return back to buffering

  BufferManager test
    ✔ initializes updates the cache and gets the root id
    ✔ adds a new buffer and flushes to runner right away
    ✔ two buffer events are chained

  Testee
    ✔ should fail fast if tests files are not found
    ✔ reporterOptions should be passed to reporter init (209ms)
